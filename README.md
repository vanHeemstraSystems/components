The Components Subtree

##Best Practices
- Use Composition over Inheritance (see https://reactjsnews.com/composing-components/#move-over-mixins-use-higher-order-components ). A video explaining the difference (see https://youtu.be/dYUZiJEy0JE )
- Mixins Are Dead. Long Live Composition (see https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/mixins-are-dead-long-live-higher-order-components-94a0d2f9e750#.y90lczqlf )

##Categorizing components
- Following LEGO, the LEGO Element ID is the combination of LEGO Design ID and LEGO Color ID. So Component Design ID is the combination of Purpose ID and Style ID.
e.g. Component Design ID '8765-4321' is the combination of Purpose ID '8765' and Style ID '4321'  

Some of the components in this collection are taken from the following sources:
